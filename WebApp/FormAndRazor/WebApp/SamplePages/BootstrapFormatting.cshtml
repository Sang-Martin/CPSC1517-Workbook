<blockquote>
    Bootstrap is a css style sheet created as open source. It contains about 10,000 lines of css code.
    Using various aspects of this style sheet, can allow us to quickly via classes, block format our web page.
    Bootstrap will also allow for text alignment, setting up nicely formatted grid display create color buttons, banners, etc.<br />
    Alert class allows for color blocking an area plus other stuff. It has built in padding. 4 basic colors can be obtained by using alert-success, alert-info, alert-warning, and alert-danger.
    Default block aignment is left. You can change that using text-xxxx where xxxx is left, right or center.
    <br /><br />
    WARNING: Bootstrap is open source third party and is subject to change. Thus, items that were once available may NOT be available in the future or may be altered. For Bootstrap, if you wish to override a class, it is best to code your own style sheet and NOT alter the NuGet package itself.
